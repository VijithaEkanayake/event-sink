<h1>Configuring Event Sinks</h1>

<p>Before adding a BAM mediator to a mediator sequence BAM mediator configurations should be updated
    as below. Configuration information are basically considered as a set of BAM server profiles
    which contains transport and credential data required to connect to the BAM server. In each BAM
    server profile one or many Event Stream configurations should be defined. Streams contains CEP
    event stream related information like Stream Name, Stream Version etc and data to be extracted
    from the configuration context of the mediation sequence.</p>
<ol>
    <li>To go to the configuration of Event Sinks go to&nbsp;ESB management console <strong>Configure&rarr;Event
        Sinks</strong>
        menu.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>If there are no existing Event Sinks (in the very first time) click <strong>Add
        Event Sink</strong> to
        add a new Event Sink.<br/><br/><img
                src="images/no-event-sinks.png"
                class="confluence-embedded-image"/><br/><br/></li>

    <li>If there are Event Sinks already existing either creation of new Event or editing an already
        existing Event Sink is possible by clicking on their <strong>Edit</strong> link. If
        there are unnecessary Event Sink they can be deleted by clicking on their <strong>
            delete</strong>
        link.<br/><br/><img src="images/with_event_sinks.png"
                            class="confluence-embedded-image"/><br/><br/></li>
    <li>Enter a name for Event Sink in <strong>Name</strong>.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Enter Credentials revelant to the data-bridge end point in Username and Password.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>In <strong>Server Transport</strong> select <strong>Thrift</strong> as the default
        <strong>Protocol</strong>.<br/><br/>
    </li>
    <li>If message confidentiality is required from ESB server to BAM server tick on <strong>Enable
        Security</strong>.<br/><br/>
    </li>
    <li>Enter the IP address of the BAM server's Thrift server as the <strong>IP Address</strong>.
        By default it is the IP address of the localhost.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>If security was not enabled <strong>Receiver Port</strong> will be asked and enter <strong>7611</strong>
        by default which is the Thrift server port.<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Authentication Port</strong> should be given the port number of 100 higher than the
        Receiver Port if it exists. Default Authentication Port
        number is <strong>7711</strong>.<br/><br/><img
